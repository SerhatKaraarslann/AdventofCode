# Advent of Code Solutions
Until this year I don't know the Advent of Code event. A friend of mine told me about it, so I decided to give it a try this year (2025).
In this repository, I will be sharing my solutions to the puzzles from Advent of Code 2025.
I solve the puzzles using Python, and each day's solution is organized in its own folder.
This puzzle event is a great way to practice programming skills and have fun with problem-solving.

#The Concept of this Repository
Advent of Code is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles.
The puzzles start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense (Day 1 = Dec 1), and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).
Every day has two parts, and solving the first part unlocks the second part.
After solving both parts of a day's puzzle, participants earn two stars for that day.
More information about Advent of Code can be found at https://adventofcode.com/.

# Repository Structure
In this repository, you will find my type of solving of Advent of Code puzzles.
Each day is represented by a folder named "DayX", where X is the day number.
Inside each folder, there are two files:
- `dayx.py`: Contains the solution for part 1 of the day's puzzle.
- `dayxpart2.py`: Contains the solution for part 2 of the day's puzzle.
- `input.txt`: Contains the input data for the day's puzzle.
- 'part1.txt': Contains the puzzle and expected output example for part 1.
- 'part2.txt': Contains the puzzle and expected output example for part 2.

To run the solutions, simply execute the Python files using a Python interpreter.
For example, to run the solution for Day 1, use the following command:

python Day1/day1.py

Make sure to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed. Happy coding!
